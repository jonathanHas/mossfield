## Current Issue: Variable Weight Input Fields Not Rendering

### Problem
The individual weight input fields for variable-weight cheese items are not displaying in the fulfillment UI at `/order-allocations/{order}`.

### What Should Happen
When fulfilling cheese wheels (variable weight items), the UI should show:
- A quantity selector (dropdown)
- Individual weight input fields for each unit (#1, #2, #3, etc.)
- A running total of all entered weights
- The total weight is submitted as `actual_weight_kg`

### What's Currently Happening
- The "Variable Weight" badge shows correctly
- The "Weight" column appears in the allocations table
- The quantity selector and "Fulfill" button appear
- But the individual weight input rows (#1, #2, #3) are NOT rendering
- Only "Total: kg" shows with no input fields above it

### Files Involved
- `resources/views/orders/partials/allocation-items.blade.php` (the variable-weight Fulfill form — was `order-allocations/show.blade.php` before allocation was folded inline on 2026-05-25)
  - Contains the form with Blade `@for` loops to render weight inputs
  - JavaScript functions `updateWeightInputs()` and `updateTotal()` at bottom
- `app/Http/Controllers/OrderAllocationController.php`
  - `fulfill()` method handles the form submission
  - Expects `quantity` and `actual_weight_kg` parameters

### Test Order
- Order 12 (`ORD-20260110-004`)
- Contains 3 Mossfield Farmhouse Cheese Whole Wheels (variable weight)
- Allocation #18 has 3 units allocated, 0 fulfilled

### Debugging Steps Tried
1. Verified `isVariableWeight()` returns `true` for the order item
2. Cleared view cache (`php artisan view:clear`)
3. Tried Alpine.js approach - didn't render
4. Switched to plain Blade `@for` loops with vanilla JavaScript - still not rendering

### Possible Causes to Investigate
1. **Blade Compilation Issue**: The `@for` loops might not be compiling correctly
2. **View Caching**: Old cached view might still be served (try hard refresh in browser)
3. **Conditional Logic**: Check if `$allocation->quantity_remaining > 0` evaluates correctly
4. **HTML Structure**: Verify the form HTML is actually in the page source (View Source in browser)

### Quick Test
```bash
# Check if weight inputs are in the compiled view
php artisan view:clear
# Then check raw HTML output:
curl -s "http://mossfield.local/order-allocations/12" | grep -A5 "weight-row"
```

## Recently Completed Features

### Order Totals Reflect Actual Fulfilled Weight (2026-05-25)

For weight-priced items, the order page showed the **estimate** (`line_total`, nominal weight) even after fulfilment recorded the real weight — most visibly on dispatched/delivered orders (read-only items table) and the order totals.

- `OrderItem::invoiceable_total` now returns the **fulfilled total** (recorded weight × `unit_price`) when a line is **fully fulfilled** (and > 0), else the estimate. (Only when fully fulfilled, so a partially-picked line isn't understated.)
- `Order::calculateTotals()` sums `invoiceable_total` (was `line_total`), so stored `subtotal`/`total_amount` reflect actuals once picked. `OrderAllocationController::fulfill()`/`unfulfill()` re-run it; existing orders were recomputed once.
- Read-only items table + allocation-block header show `invoiceable_total` with a `kg` hint for weight-priced lines.
- **Known caveat**: `unit_price` is locked per line at order creation. Orders created **before** a variant was switched to €/kg keep the old per-unit `unit_price` (e.g. €35), so their weight totals are off until repriced. New orders capture the current rate. (Not auto-fixed — repricing history is a deliberate action.)
- Tests: `OrderFulfillmentWeightTest` extended — order total reflects fulfilled weight; dispatched order shows actual value + kg, not the estimate.

### Weigh Cheese at Fulfilment — Capture Enabled + Bulk Mode for Packs (2026-05-25)

Variable-weight fulfilment existed in code but was invisible: the weight-entry UI is gated on `is_variable_weight`, and **no cheese variant had it set** (the seeder never did), so cheese lines only showed a plain quantity "Fulfill". Plus packs needed a different entry style (one total vs per-unit).

- **Enabled weight capture on cheese**: data migration `2026_05_25_120100_enable_variable_weight_on_cheese_variants` sets `is_variable_weight=true` on all cheese variants (and `is_bulk_weighed=true` on packs); seeder updated to match for fresh installs. (Ran on dev DB.)
- **New `product_variants.is_bulk_weighed`** (migration `..._120000`): for variable-weight items, picks the entry style — per-unit (wheels) vs single total (vacuum packs). Added to `ProductVariant` fillable/cast, `ProductVariantRequest`, and both variant forms ("Weigh in bulk (single total)" checkbox).
- **Fulfilment form** (`orders/partials/allocation-items.blade.php`) branches on `OrderItem::isBulkWeighed()`: per-unit (`weights[]` + running-total JS, unchanged) vs a single "Total weight (kg)" box. Both post one `actual_weight_kg`; `OrderAllocationController::fulfill()` is unchanged.
- **Pricing left to the operator** (decision: price by €/kg, but current prices are per-unit): the migration does **not** touch `is_priced_by_weight`/`base_price`. To switch a cheese variant to €/kg, edit it → tick "Priced by weight" → set the €/kg base price. Suggested rates (price ÷ nominal kg): Farmhouse Wheel €14/kg, Farmhouse Pack €18/kg, Garlic&Basil Wheel €20/kg, Garlic&Basil Pack €25/kg. Until then weight is recorded but invoicing stays per-unit.
- Future: a mobile factory fulfilment page will reuse this flag/data model.
- Tests: `tests/Feature/OrderFulfillmentWeightTest.php` (6) — bulk weight-priced fulfil, per-unit fulfil, UI branch per style, form persistence, seeder flags.

### Status Integrity on Pick-Undo + Cancel Now Returns All Stock (2026-05-25)

Found via a stuck order (ready, but 0 allocated/0 fulfilled, still showing "ready for dispatch"). Root cause: `OrderAllocationController::deallocate()` and `unfulfill()` never re-checked order status, so undoing a pick left a "ready" order falsely ready. Fixed + tightened the cancel flow:

- **`deallocate()` and `unfulfill()` now call `Order::reconcilePickingStatus()`** — undoing a pick drops a `ready` order back to `preparing`.
- **Cancel returns all stock**: `OrderController::update()`'s cancel branch now calls `OrderItem::releaseUnits()` per line, restoring **both** reserved and picked units (previously fulfilled allocations were retained, stranding picked stock — this supersedes the "Cancelling an Order Releases Unfulfilled Allocations" entry below).
- **`Order::canBeCancelled()` widened** to `pending|confirmed|preparing|ready` so not-yet-shipped orders (incl. ready) can be cancelled; the show-page Cancel button follows it.
- **Removing the only line cancels the order** (keeps the line as history, returns stock) instead of being blocked — so single-line stuck orders have an exit. The per-line Remove button now shows on the last line too, with a "Remove (cancels order)" confirm.
- Tests: `unfulfilling/deallocating drops a ready order back to preparing` (OrderAllocationStatusTransitionsTest), `cancelling a ready order returns picked stock` (OrderTransitionsTest), `removing the only line cancels the order and restores stock` (OrderItemEditTest).

### Edit & Remove Order Items, with Stock Unwind (2026-05-25)

Lines on an existing order can now have their quantity changed or be removed entirely — and, critically, the picked stock is returned to its batch. Previously the `order_allocations.order_item_id` FK was `onDelete('cascade')`, so deleting an item hard-deleted its allocations **without** restoring `BatchItem.quantity_remaining` (stranded stock). That gap is now closed.

- **`OrderItem::releaseUnits(int $units)`** (new) unwinds committed quantity reserved-first (no stock change) then fulfilled-last via the existing `unfulfillAllocation()` (restores `quantity_remaining`); rolls up the line's counters; transaction-safe.
- **`OrderController::updateItem()`** (`PATCH /orders/{order}/items/{orderItem}`): increase just raises `quantity_ordered` (picker shows the shortfall); decrease calls `releaseUnits(old − new)`. **`destroyItem()`** (`DELETE …`): `releaseUnits(quantity_allocated)` then delete; refuses to remove the only line (cancel instead).
- **`Order::reconcilePickingStatus()`** (new) is now the canonical ready⇄preparing rule (ready+unpicked → preparing; preparing+fully-picked → ready), reused by add/edit/remove. One-directional — never demotes to confirmed.
- **Guards**: office/admin only (`authorize('update')`, factory 403); blocked on dispatched/delivered/cancelled.
- **UI**: per-line "Qty + Update" and "Remove line" controls in the inline allocation partial (confirmed/preparing/ready) and the read-only items table (pending), gated `@can('update')` + `$canAddItems`; remove confirms that picked stock will be returned.
- New tests in `tests/Feature/OrderItemEditTest.php` (9): reduce-reserved (no stock change), reduce-below-fulfilled (stock restored), increase reverts ready→preparing, remove unfulfilled/fulfilled lines (exact stock restore), remove-unpicked-line flips preparing→ready, can't-remove-last-line, factory 403, dispatched blocked.

### Add Items to an Existing Order (2026-05-25)

Order items used to be frozen after creation (`orders/edit.blade.php` said so explicitly, and there was no route to add one). Now they can be added from the order detail page — including to an already-picked **ready** order — via `POST /orders/{order}/items` (`orders.items.store` → `OrderController::storeItem()`).

- **Merge-by-variant**: adding a product already on the order bumps that line's `quantity_ordered` (no duplicate row); a new product creates a line with `unit_price = base_price`. `Order::calculateTotals()` re-runs either way.
- **Ready → Preparing**: adding unpicked work to a `ready` order reverts it to `preparing`; fulfilling the new line flips it back to `ready` via the existing `markPickingComplete()`. Because allocation is now inline on the order page, the added line's stock picker shows immediately.
- **Guards**: office/admin only (`authorize('update')`; factory 403); blocked on `dispatched`/`delivered`/`cancelled` (error flash, no change).
- **UI**: an "Add item" panel on `orders/show.blade.php` (product `<select>` grouped via the new shared `OrderController::activeVariantsGrouped()` + quantity), gated `@can('update', $order)` and shown only on open statuses. `orders/edit.blade.php`'s stale "items can't be modified" note now points at the order page; editing/removing existing lines is still not supported.
- New tests in `tests/Feature/OrderAddItemTest.php` (6): new-item-on-ready reverts to preparing, merge bumps the line, confirmed stays confirmed, factory 403, dispatched rejects, and the form shows on open / hides on delivered.

### Stock Allocation Folded Into the Order Detail Page (2026-05-25)

The picking/allocation UI is now rendered **inline on `/orders/{order}`** instead of on the separate full-width `/order-allocations/{order}` page. That separate page dropped the master-detail sibling sidebar and the Order-information / Customer cards, so moving from "Confirmed" to "Picking/Ready" lost all the surrounding order context — the merge keeps the sidebar, cards, and status stepper visible throughout. (This closes the "bigger merge worth a separate decision" note that used to be in the Order Show master-detail entry.)

- **Conditional render** in `resources/views/orders/show.blade.php`: when `order.status ∈ {confirmed, preparing, ready}` the "Order items" panel is replaced by `@include('orders.partials.allocation-items')`; other statuses keep the plain read-only items table. The subtotal/tax/total summary moved into its own panel and renders in both branches (`@can('see-financials')`).
- **New partial** `resources/views/orders/partials/allocation-items.blade.php` — the per-item block (progress bar, current-allocations table, Fulfill/Remove/Undo forms, variable-weight per-unit weight inputs + the `updateWeightInputs`/`updateTotal` JS, available-stock picker, Auto allocate). **Every interactive form is gated `@can('update', $order)`** so factory users see the same data read-only.
- **New trait** `app/Http/Controllers/Concerns/BuildsAllocationData.php` (mirrors `BuildsProductList`): `buildAvailableBatchItems(Order)` extracted from `OrderAllocationController::show()` and reused by `OrderController::show()`, which now only builds it when the rich block will render AND the user can update the order.
- **`OrderAllocationController::show()` now redirects to `orders.show`** (old route kept for bookmarks/worklist/dashboard). The write actions (`allocate`/`deallocate`/`fulfill`/`unfulfill`/`autoAllocate`) switched from `redirect()->back()` to `redirect()->route('orders.show', $order)`. The standalone `order-allocations/show.blade.php` view was deleted; the worklist `index` stays and its rows + the dashboard "Allocate →" link now point at `orders.show`.
- New tests in `tests/Feature/OrderShowAllocationInlineTest.php` (5): office sees the inline forms on a confirmed order, factory sees read-only, pending shows the plain table, ready keeps the Undo controls, and the old route redirects.

### Cancelling an Order Releases Unfulfilled Allocations (2026-05-22)

Previously, transitioning an order's status to `cancelled` via `OrderController::update()` left every `OrderAllocation` row in place — the reserved units kept showing as "allocated" on `/stock` and never returned to the available pool. Fixed by wrapping the status write in a DB transaction and, on the `* → cancelled` transition, deleting every allocation with `quantity_fulfilled = 0` then recomputing each `order_item.quantity_allocated` from the surviving rows (same rule as `OrderAllocationController::deallocate()`).

- ~~Allocations with `quantity_fulfilled > 0` are deliberately left in place~~ **(superseded 2026-05-25 — cancel now returns ALL stock via `releaseUnits`; see the status-integrity entry above).**
- Stock value on `/stock` automatically rebounds because `StockOverviewService` no longer sees the cancelled order's allocations offsetting `quantity_remaining`.
- New test `test_cancelling_an_order_releases_unfulfilled_allocations` in `tests/Feature/OrderTransitionsTest.php` covers the happy path: 10-unit allocation, cancel via `PUT /orders/{order}`, assert allocation row gone, order item's `quantity_allocated = 0`, batch's `quantity_remaining` unchanged.

### Stock Overview — Per-Batch Rows with Sold Counts (2026-05-22)

Restructured `/stock` so every (variant, batch) pair gets its own row instead of aggregating across batches for a variant. Sold units are now surfaced for milk and yoghurt the same way they were for cheese.

- **`StockOverviewService` data shape**:
  - `buildSimpleCard()` (milk + yoghurt) groups by `product_variant_id|batch_id` instead of `product_variant_id`. Each row carries a single `batch_code` (string), a per-batch `expiry`/`expiry_warn`, and segments `{ available, allocated, sold }`. `total` is now `quantity_produced` (matches cheese), `sold = produced − remaining`, `available = remaining − allocated`. Rows are sorted by variant name then production date (ASC, FIFO).
  - `buildCheeseCard()` does the same `variant|batch` grouping for wheels and packs; each row gets `batch_code`. Wheel cut/sold math (`source_cutting_logs_count`-driven) was already per batch_item, so the per-row breakdown is naturally correct.
  - New `variant_count` key on the simple cards so the subtitle ("N variants · M active batches") counts distinct variants even though `variants` now contains row-per-batch entries.
- **Components** — `case-blocks` (milk), `case-pictograph` (yoghurt), and `cheese-row` (cheese) all take a single `batchCode` string prop now and render it in monospace under the label. State order extended to include `sold` so milk/yoghurt grids paint sold cases with `--state-sold` (the near-black already in `resources/css/stock.css`), and the side stat block adds a `sold` column.
- **View** — `resources/views/stock/overview.blade.php` reads `$milk['variant_count']` / `$yoghurt['variant_count']` for the subtitle counts and passes `batch-code` (singular) to each row component.
- Tests in `tests/Feature/StockOverviewTest.php` still pass — the existing assertions don't probe the row shape, just that the page renders and shows the variant name.

### Product Show + Edit — Master-Detail Layout (2026-04-27)

Same pattern as the orders master-detail (shipped earlier today), now applied to `/products/{product}` (show) and `/products/{product}/edit`. The `/products` index is unchanged — drilling in via **View** or **Edit** is what flips you into the new layout.

- **`ProductController::show()` and `edit()`** both now accept `Request` and call a new private helper `buildProductList()` that fetches up to 50 sibling products (eager-loading variants with `withSum('batchItems as total_stock', 'quantity_remaining')` to keep the no-N+1 invariant), force-includes the selected product, and sorts by `$typeOrder = ['milk','yoghurt','cheese']` then name. Views receive `$productList`, `$listFilters`, `$listTotal`, `$listLimit`. Filter passthrough is wired but a no-op today (index has no filters); helper accepts `type`, `is_active`, `search` for future filter UI without a refactor.
- **`update()` now redirects to `products.show($product)`** instead of `products.index`. Behavior change, intentional — matches `OrderController::update()` so the user lands on the master-detail with their just-edited product highlighted on the right. `destroy()` redirect stays at index (the product no longer exists).
- **New partial `resources/views/products/_sibling_list.blade.php`** — single source of truth for the sidebar, used by both show and edit. Renders products grouped by type with passive subheads (no `<details>` collapsing — there are ~10 products total, collapse is overkill). Each row shows name, variant count, total stock, and an Inactive tag when applicable. Active row gets the same accent-bar treatment as the orders sidebar.
- **Mode-aware sibling links** — sidebar rows on `show` link to `products.show`, rows on `edit` link to `products.edit`. So a user editing many products in a row stays in edit mode; toggling modes goes through the existing **Edit** / **View** button in the detail header. Resolves via `route('products.'.$mode, ...)`.
- **Variant pages (`products.variants.create/edit`) also wrapped** in the same master-detail layout (added in the same change). Sidebar product rows link to `products.show` from variant pages (not `variants.create/edit`, which would require a target-product context that doesn't make sense across products). When on a variant page, the active product's row expands inline to show **its variants** with edit links — quick variant-to-variant navigation within the same product. Active variant gets its own accent bar; sidebar takes `$showActiveVariants` (bool) and `$activeVariant` (model or null) options.
- **Shared list-builder**: `app/Http/Controllers/Concerns/BuildsProductList.php` trait holds `buildProductList(Request, Product): array`. Used by both `ProductController` (show + edit) and `ProductVariantController` (create + edit). When filter passthrough lands on `/products` later, update the trait once.
- **Known limitation**: clicking a sibling on edit / variant edit pages discards unsaved form changes silently. Not guarded — revisit if it bites in practice.

### Order Show — Master-Detail Layout (2026-04-27)

`/orders/{order}` is now a two-pane layout: a sticky list of sibling orders on the left/middle (320px column on `lg+`) and the existing detail content on the right. The index table at `/orders` is unchanged — drilling in is what flips you into the new view.

- **`OrderController::show()`** also fetches up to 50 sibling orders, mirroring whatever `status` / `payment_status` / `customer_id` filters were active on the index. Selected order is force-included in the list even if it falls outside the cap or filters (so deep links from elsewhere still highlight correctly).
- **Filter passthrough** — `orders/index.blade.php` row links forward active filters into the show URL via `array_merge($rowFilters, ['order' => $order->id])`, so the master pane on the show screen matches what the user was looking at on the index.
- **Sibling list rows** show order number, customer name, top-3 item summary (`2× Cheese · 1× Yoghurt …`), status tag, total (gated on `see-financials`), and a relative timestamp. Active row gets a left accent bar + soft background.
- **Mobile** — list pane is `hidden lg:flex`; below `lg` the detail renders alone with a "← All orders" button (which itself preserves filters back to the index).
- **Allocation panel now folded into this screen** (2026-05-25) — the picking UI renders inline here; `Manage allocation →` was removed and `/order-allocations/{order}` redirects back to this page. See "Stock Allocation Folded Into the Order Detail Page" above.

### Batches & Cheese-Cutting UI Redesign (2026-04-22)

Restructured `/batches` and `/cheese-cutting` to mirror the `/products` grouped-card layout, with a visual wheel/vac-pack status indicator in every cheese batch header:

- **`/batches`** — batches now group by product type (Milk → Yoghurt → Cheese) and, within Cheese, sub-group by variety (Farmhouse, Garlic & Basil, etc.). Three collapse levels (type → variety → individual batch) via native `<details>`/`<summary>` — no Alpine dependency; all collapsed by default so users expand only what they need. Filters and pagination preserved at the outer level.
- **Wheel circles in card header** — for each cheese batch, one small circle per wheel produced: **yellow = remaining**, **grey = cut to vac packs**, **black = sold as whole wheel**. Sourced from `quantity_produced`, `quantity_remaining`, and `cheese_cutting_logs.source_batch_item_id` count. Always visible in the header (not hidden behind the collapse) so users can scan wheel status at a glance.
- **Vac-pack mini-bar in card header** — compact 128px stacked bar (yellow=remaining, black=sold) proportional to produced count, plus a text readout (`N / N packs · N sold`). Chose this over per-pack markers because vac packs can run into the hundreds and individual markers don't scale; the bar reads identically at any count.
- **Cheese-variety header summary** — each sub-group header also shows aggregated wheel totals (remaining/cut/sold across all batches of that variety) so the summary is visible even when all batches below are collapsed.
- **`/cheese-cutting`** — same layout applied (cheese-variety sub-groups, collapsible batch cards with wheel circles + pack bars). Expanded body keeps the original "Available Wheels" grid with per-variant **Cut Wheel** action buttons, and the "Vacuum Packs Created" summary.
- **Controller changes** — `BatchController::index()` and `CheeseCuttingController::index()` both eager-load `batchItems` with `withCount('sourceCuttingLogs')` so the cut-count lookup is one query per page (no N+1).
- **New partials** — `resources/views/batches/partials/batch-card.blade.php` and `resources/views/cheese-cutting/partials/batch-card.blade.php`. The wheel-status helper closure (`$wheelStatsFor`) is inlined at the top of each index view.

### Batch Create Form — De-duplicate Wheel Count (2026-04-22)
The cheese batch create form had operators entering the wheel count twice: once in a top-level "Number of Wheels Produced" input and again in the wheel variant's "Quantity Produced" row under Production Breakdown. The instruction text even said "This should match the wheel count above."

- `resources/views/batches/create.blade.php` — removed the `#cheese-wheels-section` block and its JS (`wheelsInput`, `cheeseWheelsSection` branches in `updateFormForProductType`). Dropped the "match the wheel count above" phrase from the cheese instructions.
- `app/Http/Controllers/BatchController.php` — removed `wheels_produced` from request validation and the manual cheese-specific validation block. `batches.wheels_produced` is now derived inside the transaction as `array_sum(batch_items.quantity_produced)` for cheese, `null` otherwise. Safe because the view only submits wheel variants for cheese (vacuum packs are created later via cutting — see create.blade.php variant filter).
- Display sites (`batches/show`, `batches/partials/batch-card`) and the store success message were untouched — they still read `$batch->wheels_produced`, which is still populated.

### Security Rollout — Dev Exercise (2026-04-22)

Applied the dev-safe subset of the post-Phase-3 operator actions on the shared dev box, end-to-end:

- Dumped both MySQL DBs to `/tmp/{mossfield,mossorders}-pre-sec-20260422-*.sql` before running migrations.
- Ran the three pending migrations (`backfill_email_verified_at_for_existing_users` on both apps + `encrypt_customer_pii` on mossfield). Spot-checked: `customers.phone` / `customers.address` are ciphertext in DB (`eyJpdiI6…`).
- Updated both `.env` files: `SESSION_ENCRYPT=true`, `SESSION_SAME_SITE=strict`, `OFFICE_API_ALLOWED_IPS=127.0.0.1,::1`, `SYNC_SCHEDULE_ENABLED=true`. Left `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=false` because dev runs over HTTP.
- Verified `schedule:list` shows the hourly sync commands on both apps.
- Triggered manual syncs; `storage/logs/sync-2026-04-22.log` shows a proper `run summary` line with correlation id + duration on each side.
- Confirmed the API auth chain: 200 from loopback + valid token, 401 on bad/missing token, 403 from a LAN source (`10.42.1.83`) because that IP is off the allowlist.
- Audit log in `laravel.log` logs every outcome (`accepted`, `invalid token`, `ip not allowed`) — verified.

**Gap remaining:** nothing runs `php artisan schedule:run` every minute on this box. The hourly schedule entries are registered but inert until a cron line is added (`DEPLOYMENT.md` §6 has the exact line). Decision pending from user on whether to add the dev cron now or wait for prod.

**New doc:** created [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md) as the single operator runbook for production installs. Mirrored on the mossorders repo.

### Security Review — Phases 1–3 (2026-04-20)

End-to-end hardening of the Mossfield ↔ Mossorders sync surface ahead of turning on the hourly scheduler. Full findings, per-item code locations, and operator runbooks in `SECURITY_NEXT_STEPS.md`. Short version:

- **API transport** — `/api/*` now runs `throttle:sync-api` (60/min per IP) → IP allowlist (`OFFICE_API_ALLOWED_IPS`) → two-token check (`OFFICE_API_TOKEN` + optional `OFFICE_API_TOKEN_PREVIOUS` via `hash_equals`) → audit log. 12 feature tests cover the chain.
- **Outbound sync** — `OnlineOrderImportService` and `OfficeProductSyncService` wrap HTTP with explicit TLS verify, 5s/10s timeouts, and 3× retry with 500ms backoff.
- **Observability** — new `sync` log channel (daily, 14-day retention) at `storage/logs/sync.log`. Each run emits one structured summary line with correlation UUID and duration. `sync:import_orders:last_ok` cached on success, rendered as a freshness strip on `/dashboard`.
- **Scheduler** — hourly `mossfield:import-online-orders` registered in `routes/console.php`, gated on `SYNC_SCHEDULE_ENABLED` (default false). `emailOutputOnFailure` wired when `SYNC_ALERT_EMAIL` is set. Deploys dormant.
- **Auth** — `User` now implements `MustVerifyEmail`; business routes require `['auth', 'verified']`; profile routes stay at `auth` only so users can reach verification. Backfill migration grandfathers existing users.
- **PII encryption** — new `App\Casts\EncryptedNullable` applied to `Customer.phone/address/city/postal_code/notes`. Cast is plaintext-tolerant on read (logs a warning) so deploy order is safe; separate idempotent backfill migration encrypts legacy rows. **Do not run the encrypt migration in prod without a DB backup.**
- **Boot guards** — `AppServiceProvider::boot` refuses to start if `APP_ENV=production` AND (`APP_DEBUG=true` OR `MOSSORDERS_BASE_URL` is not `https://`).
- **Headers** — `SecurityHeaders` middleware appends HSTS (prod only), X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy on every response.
- **Seeder** — `AdminUserSeeder` refuses to run in production; dev can override the default password via `ADMIN_SEED_PASSWORD`.
- **Mirror work on mossorders** — matching middleware, config, logging, and boot guards; `User` also gains `MustVerifyEmail` + backfill migration; `/api/orders` gains `limit` cap (max 500) and `meta.has_more`/`next_since` cursor.

**Operator actions still required** (see `SECURITY_NEXT_STEPS.md` verification checklist):
1. Run both backfill migrations in staging → prod after DB backup.
2. Set production session hardening env vars (`SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true`, `SAME_SITE=strict`, `SESSION_ENCRYPT=true`).
3. Populate `OFFICE_API_ALLOWED_IPS` once peer IPs are stable.
4. Flip `SYNC_SCHEDULE_ENABLED=true` in prod once logs look clean in staging.

### Pricing Display Consistency Across Mossfield + Mossorders (2026-04-18)
End-to-end fix for weight-priced cheese display and stock valuation:

- **mossfield**:
  - `ProductVariant::estimated_unit_price` accessor added; `OrderItem::boot()::saving` now computes `line_total` weight-aware (`qty × weight_kg × unit_price`) for `is_priced_by_weight` items
  - `StockController` valuation closures use `calculatePrice($qty)` — fixes prior overstatement on cheese (was naively `qty × base_price`)
  - Display sites switched to `$variant->price_label`: `products/index`, `products/show`, `orders/create` (3 dropdowns), `orders/show`, `orders/edit`, `stock/index` (price column + 3 valuation cells + tooltip)
  - `Api/ProductExportController` now emits `is_priced_by_weight` so mossorders can render the same way
- **mossorders**:
  - Migration adds `office_product_variants.is_priced_by_weight`; `OfficeProductSyncService` reads it from the API; `OfficeProductVariant` exposes `price_label` and `estimated_unit_price` accessors
  - `OrderController::prepareLineItems` produces weight-aware estimated totals; customer review/confirmation and admin order views show "estimated" labels and a "Final price set at fulfillment" amber banner
  - `orders/create` browse page now has a live per-row Subtotal column + running Order total (vanilla JS, recalculates on every qty change). Weight-priced rows display an "Approx Xg per pack — actual weight may vary" caption under the product name and an "estimated" subtotal label so the customer sees how the total is derived
  - **Heads-up after deploying the migration**: existing rows default to `is_priced_by_weight=false`. Run `php artisan office:sync-products` (or click sync at `/admin/office-sync`) to repopulate from the office API
- **Heads-up**: legacy `Mossfield Mature - Whole Wheel` variant has `weight_kg=null`, so it currently estimates as €0. Editing the variant via the form will force a weight (per the new validation) — fixes itself on next edit.

### Products Section Polish (2026-04-18)
Smaller wins on the products area:

- New `ProductRequest` and `ProductVariantRequest` FormRequests centralise validation: unique product names, scoped-unique variant names per product, `maturation_days` required when `type=cheese`, `weight_kg` required unless variant is variable-weight & not priced by weight, `base_price` minimum 0.01, checkbox booleans coerced via `prepareForValidation()`
- `ProductController::index/show` use `withSum('batchItems as total_stock', ...)` to kill N+1; `total_stock` accessor on `ProductVariant` prefers the eager-loaded value
- `show()` limits batches to last 10 in the controller load
- "Create Batch" button on product show is now wired to `batches.create?product_id={id}` and the batches form preselects the product from the query string
- Variant rows show `Var. wt` (amber) and `€/kg` (indigo) badges next to the name; new "Duplicate" link on each variant row opens the create form prefilled via `?from={variantId}`

### Order Notes Sync from Mossorders (2026-04-18)
Customer-typed order notes now flow through end-to-end:

- mossorders `Api/OrderExportController::transformOrder` now includes `'notes' => $order->notes` in the response
- mossfield `ImportOnlineOrders` and `OnlineOrdersController` both read `$payload['notes']` and fall back to the `"Imported from Mossorders order …"` placeholder when absent

### Variable Weight Fulfillment System (2026-01-10)
Database migrations and model support for variable-weight cheese:
- `product_variants.is_variable_weight` - Boolean flag
- `product_variants.is_priced_by_weight` - Boolean flag for €/kg pricing
- `order_allocations.actual_weight_kg` - Stores fulfilled weight
- `order_items.weight_fulfilled_kg` - Total fulfilled weight
- `order_items.fulfilled_total` - Calculated total based on weight

### Undo Fulfillment (2026-01-10)
Ability to reverse fulfillments:
- `BatchItem::restoreStock()` method
- `OrderItem::unfulfillAllocation()` method
- `OrderAllocationController::unfulfill()` action
- Route: `POST /order-allocations/{allocation}/unfulfill`
- UI: "Undo" button in allocations table

### Online Orders UI (2026-01-10)
Web interface for Mossorders integration:
- `OnlineOrdersController` with index, preview, import methods
- Views at `resources/views/online-orders/`
- Navigation link added to main nav
- Routes at `/online-orders`, `/online-orders/preview`, `/online-orders/import`

## Database State

### Migrations Run
All migrations are up to date including:
- `2026_01_10_144238_add_variable_weight_to_product_variants_table`
- `2026_01_10_144304_add_actual_weight_to_order_allocations_table`
- `2026_01_10_144316_add_fulfilled_weight_to_order_items_table`

### Cheese Variants Configuration
All cheese wheel variants are marked as variable weight:
```
Mossfield Farmhouse Cheese - Whole Wheel | variable: yes | by_weight: yes
Mossfield Garlic & Basil Cheese - Whole Wheel | variable: yes | by_weight: yes
Mossfield Tomato & Herb - Wheel | variable: yes | by_weight: yes
Mossfield Mature - Whole Wheel | variable: yes | by_weight: yes
```

Vacuum packs remain fixed weight (variable: no, by_weight: no).

## Next Steps

1. **Fix weight input rendering** - Debug why Blade `@for` loops aren't generating HTML
2. **Test full fulfillment flow** - Enter weights, submit, verify database
3. **Test undo fulfillment** - Verify stock restoration works
4. **Online Orders testing** - Test preview and import with live Mossorders instance
